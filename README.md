Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! (The Holberton B&B)

  

## Getting Started

 
**What’s a command interpreter?**

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to

be able to manage the objects of our project:

  

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)

- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…

- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)

- Update attributes of an object

- Destroy an object
